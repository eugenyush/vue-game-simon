# Vue Game Simon - A Memory Game

**Vue Game Simon** is a web-based memory game inspired by the classic Simon game, where players must repeat sequences of colors and sounds. The application provides an engaging and interactive way to test and improve memory skills.

It is built using:

- **Vue.js**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

## ðŸ‘¾ Features

- Engaging gameplay with sound and visual feedback.
- Dynamic generation of sequences that increase in complexity.
- Responsive design optimized for various screen sizes.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
- Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation.

## ðŸ“’ Process

I started by designing the core game mechanics, including the logic for generating random sequences and validating the player's input. The application is structured using Vue.js, which allows for reactive updates to the UI.

I implemented audio feedback to enhance the user experience, making it more engaging. The game keeps track of the player's score, providing a fun challenge to see how far they can go.

Styling was done using CSS3, ensuring a clean and responsive design for players on all devices.

**NOTE:** This project demonstrates the use of Vue.js for creating interactive web applications and games.
